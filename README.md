## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Ebraheem, and  I'm a 3rd year BCom Information Systems student at the University of Cape Town.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an **Online Multplayer Trivia Game Show** that a team and I are developing for Impact.com, utilizing tools such as the **Unity Game Engine, Spotify API, Firebase,** and **Networking libraries like Unity Netcode**. This repository is currenly private for confidential reasons. Due to storage limitations on Github, this project was moved to Gitlab where the activity can be tracked at https://gitlab.com/dienebraheem514
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about **RESTful API's** and how to integrate them into different projects. I am also furthering my knowledge in **Unity Game Deveopment** as I continue with the project I previously mentioned whilst simultaneously learning how to implement the **Observer Software Design Pattern** in my code.
- ðŸ‘¯ I'm seeking an **internship opportunity** during my last year of study in 2025 (which consists only of elective subjects) to further enhance my technical background and expertise and gain valuable industry experience.
- ðŸ’¼ My **LinkedIn** in profile can be found at: www.linkedin.com/in/dien-ebraheem
